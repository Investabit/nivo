    see [sample](api:/samples/chord) or
    [try it using the API client](self:/chord/api).

    See the [dedicated guide](self:/guides/legends) on how to setup
    legends for this component.

    A variation around the [Chord](self:/chord) component. Well suited
    for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth, however
    you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions (for now).

    The responsive alternative of this component is
    `ResponsiveChordCanvas`.
